# I’m a full-time MSc student in the Data & Society track of the Media and Communications Department. The program focuses on digital media and Science and Technology Studies analyses of “datafication” practices. I’m in the program partially because I want to apply to PhDs in the United States and partially because I wanted to find programs that critiqued corporate practices that I saw while working as an editor and a temp at an AI start-up. I’m still settling on a dissertation topic, but I’ll likely write something in the area of digital privacy, using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. I do not have experience with statistics outside of the introductory methodology course we had in Michaelmas term or with R, specifically. I did, however, take four computer science classes in my undergraduate program that used Python, Java, and C. I got up to working with machine assembly languages, so I’m not too worried about picking up R. 
# My undergraduate degree was in a concentration that I designed (“Formal Semantics”) that consisted of philosophy of language, formal logic, computer science, and linguistics, as well as a minor in game design. In my studies, I was interested in both attempts to formalize languages, in all their complexity, and the complicated pragmatic rules people use to interpret words or sentences. I felt drawn to natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and digital humanities as fields that dealt with those issues. I worked as a publishing editor for a while before applying to LSE, which is why I drifted towards media studies. 
# I signed up to study social network analysis both for its flexibility in application and its specific relation to modal logic and epistemology. As someone who likes to switch what disciplines I’m studying, network analysis is particularly useful—a way to talk to several different fields at once. Its strong visual component is attractive to me as well; network analysis seems like a method where the interpretation of the results and their presentation are intertwined, which is easier to grab hold of than a more abstract method with a basis in mathematics. 
# In my last year of undergrad, I took a class in modal logic that focused on its use in philosophical logic. The idea of defining knowledge as a relation about “possible worlds” captured me, and I wondered if there was a way to discuss the spread of knowledges and beliefs on a broader scale, an “epidemiology of knowledge”. I’ve since seen some related publications by researchers like Simon Dedeo about the spread of beliefs in voting behavior, and network analysis seemed like a key element of their research. 
# From the course, I would like to increase my literacy with the method both to help me understand research based on its use and for eventual future projects of my own (due to time constraints, I’m not sure if I will be able to use social network analysis for my dissertation). I’m also glad of the opportunity the course provides to brush up on my computer programming, as well as learning a new language, R.
